    name: 'General FAQ',
    questions: [
      { q: 'What is GrapeTask LMS?', a: 'GrapeTask LMS is Pakistan\'s first skill-to-earn platform. It provides high-quality practical training directly connected to a live freelance marketplace, allowing you to learn from verified experts, complete assessments, and start earning immediately.' },
      { q: 'Is GrapeTask LMS free to join?', a: 'Yes, it is completely free to create an account on GrapeTask. You only pay for individual premium courses you choose to enroll in, or if you are part of a subscribed partner institution, your access is covered by your school, college, or university.' },
      { q: 'Are the certificates verified?', a: 'Absolutely. Every certificate is backed by your actual test scores and trainer reviews, and automatically appears as a verified badge on your live GrapeTask freelance marketplace profile, making you instantly credible to global clients.' },
      { q: 'How is GrapeTask different from other platforms?', a: 'Unlike other online platforms that just offer video lectures, GrapeTask LMS features a progressive module unlocking system, manual grading of practical assignments by expert trainers, and a direct pipeline to active client contracts on the freelance marketplace.' }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 'learners',
    name: 'For Learners FAQ',
    questions: [
      { q: 'Who can join GrapeTask LMS?', a: 'Anyone can join — school students, college students, university students, and individual self-taught learners. GrapeTask LMS is open to all who want to build high-paying digital skills.' },
      { q: 'Do I need to pay to enroll in a course?', a: 'Individual learners pay per course. Institutional students (school, college, university) are enrolled by their institution under a subscription plan and do not need to pay individually.' },
      { q: 'What happens if I fail a test?', a: 'If you fail, you must re-watch the video before attempting the test again. Your next attempt will feature a completely different set of questions — not the same test repeated.' },
      { q: 'Can I skip a video and go to the next one?', a: 'No. GrapeTask LMS uses a progressive unlocking system. You must pass the assessment for each video before the next one becomes available.' },
      { q: 'What do I get after completing a course?', a: 'You receive an official GrapeTask LMS Certificate and a verified badge on your marketplace profile. You can then immediately start freelancing on GrapeTask.' },
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 'trainers',
    name: 'For Trainers FAQ',
    questions: [
      { q: 'Who can become a trainer?', a: 'Both individual professionals and training institutes can apply. You must submit your portfolio, experience, and reason for joining. The GrapeTask team will review your application.' },
      { q: 'What video quality is required for my course?', a: 'All course videos must be HD quality, recorded using professional equipment (DSLR or iPhone), in a clean professional environment, with clear audio.' },
      { q: 'How do I get paid?', a: 'Trainers receive 70% of all revenue generated from their courses. GrapeTask retains 30% for platform operations.' },
      { q: 'Can I teach at more than one level?', a: 'Yes. If you are qualified to teach at multiple levels (school, college, university), you can create courses for each level.' },
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 'institutions',
    name: 'For Institutions FAQ',
    questions: [
      { q: 'How does the institutional subscription work?', a: 'Your institution pays a monthly per-student fee based on your student level. GrapeTask provides a dedicated portal where you assign courses, manage students, and receive progress reports.' },
      { q: 'Can I get a discount for a longer commitment?', a: 'Yes. GrapeTask offers significant discounts for 6-month (25% off) and 1-year (40% off) packages. These packages are available directly from your institutional dashboard.' },
      { q: 'How are progress reports delivered?', a: 'Trainers generate reports directly in the system with one click. Reports are automatically branded with the GrapeTask logo and your institution\'s logo, then delivered to your portal inbox and email.' },
      { q: 'Can parents see their child\'s progress?', a: 'Yes. The institution head can forward reports to parents after reviewing them.' },
